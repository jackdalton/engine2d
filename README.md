## DEPRECATED

As of 21 December 2015, Engine2D is deprecated. Instead, you should use [E2D](https://github.com/jackdalton/e2d). [This blog post explains why](http://jackdalton.org/engine2d-devblog/engine2d,javascript/2015/12/21/deprecated.html).

Engine2D is a highly extensible barebones game engine.

Engine2D can be used for just about any type of 2D game, with existing HTML5 canvas renderer and collision detection extensions.

Documentation is available [here](http://jackdalton.org/engine2d/main/).

We have a development blog [here](http://jackdalton.org/engine2d-devblog).
